# Matrix-inversion-and-LU-decomposition.
Matrix inversion and LU decomposition.


for_back.m - function that will compute the appropriate elementary matrices to both forward elimination and back-substitution.

inverse.m -  function that will return the inverse of a given input matrix using (for_back.m) function, or
              an appropriate error message if the matrix is singular.
              
lup.m - a function that computes the LU-decomposition of an input matrix. The function will return L, U and P
